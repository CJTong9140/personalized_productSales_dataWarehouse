2,"Life expectancy is the number of years a person would be expected to live, starting from birth (for life expectancy at birth) and similarly for other age groups, if the age- and sex-specific mortality rates for a given observation period (such as a calendar year) were held constant over the estimated life span.",,
3,"In this table, the calculation of life expectancy is based on three consecutive years of death data and population estimates.",,
4,"Life expectancy is calculated according the methodology described in <a href=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?ObjId=84-538-X&ObjType=2&lang=en&limit=0"">Methods for Constructing Life Tables for Canada", Provinces and Territories,catalogue no. 84-538</a>. Life expectancy originates from complete life tables
5,"Rates used in this table for the calculation of life expectancy are calculated with data that exclude: births to mothers not resident in Canada; births to mothers resident in Canada, province or territory of residence unknown; deaths of non-residents of Canada; deaths of residents of Canada whose province or territory of residence was unknown; deaths for which age or sex of decedent was unknown.",,
6,Rates used for the calculation of life expectancy in this table are based on data tabulated by place of residence.,,
7,"Life expectancy for Canada, Provinces and Territories, as well as those health regions that represent the whole province or territory (PEI, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) comes from table 39-10-0007-01.",,
8,The number of deaths in Ontario for 2016 is considered preliminary.,,
9,"Health regions are administrative areas defined by provincial ministries of health according to provincial legislation. The health regions presented in this table are based on boundaries and names in effect as of December 2017. For complete Canadian coverage, each northern territory represents a health region.",,
10,"Peer groups are aggregations of health regions that share similar socio-economic and demographic characteristics, based on data from the 2011 Census of Population and 2011 National Household Survey. These are useful in the analysis of health regions, where important differences may be detected by comparing health regions within a peer group. The nine peer groups are identified by the letters A through I, which are appended to the health region 4-digit code. Caution should be taken when comparing data for the Peer Groups over time due to changes in the Peer Groups. In an analysis involving the peer groups, only one level of geography in Ontario should be used. For more information on the peer groups classification, consult Statistics Canada's publication Health Regions: Boundaries and Correspondence with Census Geography"" (catalogue number 82-402-X).""",,
11,The 95% confidence interval (CI) illustrates the degree of variability associated with a number.,,
12,"Wide confidence intervals (CIs) indicate high variability, thus, these numbers or rates should be interpreted and compared with due caution.",,
13,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period, (...) for figures not applicable and (x) for figures suppressed to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act.",,
14,"For small populations (less than 25,000), life expectancy is shown with an 'E' (use with caution) to indicate that the quality of the estimates are more affected by the imputation method used when there are no deaths for a given age group.",,
